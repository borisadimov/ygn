These fundraisers may range from the intimate at-home gathering to more formal receptions, but each is integral to the success of YGN and its efforts to enhance the lives of Special Forces veterans as they transition into their next successful career. We are so grateful for the support of individuals and businesses that recognize the value of our transition process and its tremendous benefits for our country’s heroes.

Special Operations Forces vets face unique challenges when transitioning from military service to civilian life, and there are adjustments to be made, but we assess—and build upon—their special skill set to make sure that they are best equipped to face the challenges and demands of the modern workforce.

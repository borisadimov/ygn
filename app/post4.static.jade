              | Transitioning your Special Forces military experience to the civilian world is never easy (as anyone who has handed a DD 214 to a civilian hiring manager already knows). Just deciding where to live can be daunting.

            .post_text
              | One of the biggest challenges for Special Forces veterans transitioning to civilian life is deciding the best career path. Monster.com and Indeed.com don’t have too many job listings for Green Berets or Navy SEALS, but they should. Special Forces’ transferrable skills are innumerable and fit a variety of occupations.

              | We’ve all heard the old saying about success: “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” It’s as true for landing a job as it is for climbing the professional ladder.

              | Launching a small business or being a career entrepreneur has been compared to an ultramarathon. But maybe a five-round Ultimate Fighting championship match might be a better descriptor.

          | Launching a small business or being a career entrepreneur has been compared to an ultramarathon. But maybe a five-round Ultimate Fighting championship match might be a better descriptor.

          | Even the best often fail repeatedly before finding success. This is the difference between working for the man and working for yourself. The career path is not predictable if you become an entrepreneur, but the ceiling is much higher. Unless you win the lottery, however, success won’t come overnight.

          | Persistence

        .text
          | Special Operations vets have the diligence and persistence needed to survive the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. Studies have shown that Special Forces soldiers have more mental resilience than civilian counterparts. If Special Forces vets get knocked down, they get right back up. You may already have known that, too, but it’s always good to have science on your side.

          | Taking Risks

        .text
          | Entrepreneurship can take a huge psychological toll, as many founders discover the hard way. Starting companies and pursuing business ventures takes a huge amount of risk, with no guarantee of success. Successful entrepreneurs don’t mind taking chances, and know that there can be immense rewards waiting at the other end after so many sacrifices and a ton of hard work. Sound familiar?

        .text
          | Special Operations veterans have what the New York Times once called “A Bulletproof Mind”—a mind that is able to withstand stress that would paralyze other people. It may come from the intense training, preparation, and missions Special Operations vets experience throughout their careers. These veterans eat stress for breakfast. This is no idle skill for new entrepreneurs. Staying calm under pressure doesn’t just save you from damp armpits during a meeting—it has a direct impact on your performance.

          | Flexibility

        .text
          | Successful entrepreneurs believe in their ideas, of course, but also know how to adapt to changes to succeed. Chances are your business plan will get shaken up along the way by all the variables involved in starting a company. Great entrepreneurs roll with the punches, adapt, and come back stronger for it.
          
        .text
          | This is nothing new to Special Operations soldiers. From leadership to those with boots on the ground, Special Operations missions rely on flexible, adaptable soldiers who can go off-script when things go wrong. You will need to change your game plan on the fly to be a successful entrepreneur. After years of high performance in changing circumstances, adaptability is second nature to Special Operations vets. 
          
        .subtitle
          | Integrity

        .text
          | Last, but by no means least, successful business leaders rely on integrity. In fact, most entrepreneurs succeed because of their integrity. As CNN.com noted, “SOCOM also places a high value on less tangible characteristics in its recruits, such as courage, integrity, humility, creativity and resiliency.” It’s simple: leaders need integrity, and Special Forces soldiers are called upon to lead many times in their careers.

          | If this sounds like a soft skill for an entrepreneur, just ask Martin Shkreli, the latest face of corporate corruption. He rose to infamy for jacking up the price of life-saving medication, but that is not why he is currently facing serious jail time (and watching his businesses collapse). The media attention on this man shed light on his dishonest business practices…and his lack of integrity sank him.
